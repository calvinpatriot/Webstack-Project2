## Installation

To get started with Moviedux, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/calvinpatriot/Webstack-Project2.git
   cd webstackmovie
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Project

To run the project locally on your machine, use the following commands:

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the app in development mode and open it in your default browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

2. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

   This will run the test suite using Jest. You can interactively watch your tests in the terminal.

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will build the app for production to the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

4. **Eject the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run eject
   ```

   **Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back! This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and dependencies into your project so you have full control over them.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm run eject`: Ejects the project from `create-react-app`.

## Project Structure
